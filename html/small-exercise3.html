    This exercise is about making lists
    <div>
        Here's what I like about lists:
        <ul>
            <li>
                They're useful for displaying lists of stuff
            </li>
            <li>
                That's about it
            </li>
            <li>
                I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool
            </li>
            <div>
            When you make a list, do it in this order:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Decide if it's an ordered list or not
                </li>
                <li>
                    If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Use li tags nested in the list for your list items
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    You've got this, I believe in you!
                </li>
            </ol>
            </div>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>
